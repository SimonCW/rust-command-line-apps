     1	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
     2	Don't worry, spiders,
     3	I keep house
     4	casually.
     5	The bustle in a house
     6	The morning after death
     7	Is solemnest of industries
     8	Enacted upon earth,â€”
     9	
    10	The sweeping up the heart,
    11	And putting love away
    12	We shall not want to use again
    13	Until eternity.
